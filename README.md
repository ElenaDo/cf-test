### What I could do better

##### (If I have more time)

- Add loading animation on fetching course list
- Add "**Enroll**" button with link to the course
- Add hover animation on buttons and course cards
- Apply styles similar to existing landing pages
- Display error if fetch didn't succeed
- Optimize css (and scss instead of css)
